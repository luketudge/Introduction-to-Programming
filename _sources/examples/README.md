# Example programs

This directory contains the example Python programs discussed in the topic notes. You can click on one of the program files above to view its contents online, and/or download all of them in the compressed file [intro_prog_examples.zip](intro_prog_examples.zip).

Some examples make use of additional data files. These are provided in the [data](data) subdirectory, which is included in *intro_prog_examples.zip*. The examples assume that this directory structure is preserved if you download and unzip the archive, i.e. they will look for the data files in a subdirectory called *data*.
