    "\n",
    "## Calling functions\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard syntax for using a function is:\n",
    "\n",
    "* write the name of the function\n",
    "* open parentheses `(`\n",
    "* (optionally) write any inputs to the function\n",
    "  * multiple inputs must be separated by commas\n",
    "* close parentheses `)`\n",
    "\n",
    "The function will then output some result (although a few functions have no output).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few important pieces of computing vocabulary associated with functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Call**. Running a function is known as '[calling](glossary.ipynb#call)' the function. When we run a function, this is sometimes termed a 'function call'. It is as if the function is playing outside in the garden, and then we call it in because we want it to do something for us.\n",
    "* **Argument**. The inputs to a function, which go inside the parentheses, are known as the function's '[arguments](glossary.ipynb#argument)'. This is very different from the everyday use of the word 'argument', but is probably distantly related to the sense of 'argument' as meaning 'valid or confirmatory information'. According to *[The Origins of Mathematical Words](https://muse.jhu.edu/book/26769)*, astronomers used to compile tables of numbers about the positions of celestial bodies, and then input these numbers into further calculations. These validated input numbers were known as 'arguments' in the sense of 'supporting information'.\n",
    "* **Return value**. The output of the function is known as its '[return value](glossary.ipynb#return)'. When the function has finished doing its work and reports back to us with the result, we say that the function has 'returned' that result.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can see some of these terms in action in a few [error messages](glossary.ipynb#error) that we encounter if we use a function incorrectly. For example if we try to [call](glossary.ipynb#call) something that is not a function:"

So when we write a function we often don't know whether it works correctly or not until we have finished writing it and can finally [call](glossary.ipynb#call) it.
