    "\n",
    "We have learned how to work with data organized as an [array](arrays.ipynb) of numbers, using the `numpy` package, or more generally as a [table](data_analysis.ipynb) of numeric and text columns, using `pandas`. We have also learned a bit about [working with image files](images.ipynb). The other major data format that you are likely to encounter in many computer programming tasks is natural, human-language text.\n",
    "\n",
    "In computing, people often refer to the languages that human beings use for everyday communication, such as English or Pirah√°, as 'natural' languages. This distinguishes them from programming languages like Python, and helps avoid confusion, for example when asking a computer person 'What language do you use at work?' Using computers to analyze natural language is often called 'Natural Language Processing' (NLP).\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike humans, computers still have huge difficulty responding to natural language appropriately. Here we will introduce a few tools and techniques that can help if we need to write a computer program that takes natural language text as its input. These techniques are necessary, often as an initial step, in many common programming tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "* translating between natural languages\n",
    "* classifying texts by topic\n",
    "* identifying particular tones or styles, for example rude or offensive posts in a forum\n",
    "* creating chatbots or generating automated responses to customer queries\n",
    "* ... and even some genuinely useful things like [establishing the authorship of anonymous works of literature](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.5555/1314498.1314541)\n",
    "\n",
    "Real-world natural language processing tasks like these are usually quite complex, and require a 'pipeline' of multiple techniques. As usual, we will just dip in our toes while keeping our Birkenstock sandals firmly on. After our short introduction, you should know at least where to start if you later come to work with natural language text data.\n",

    "Here is our toy task for this lesson.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine we have landed a job as an editor at a pretentious elitist newspaper, and we would like to write a program that helps us identify all the sentences in a text that violate one of the woefully misguided rules of the newspaper's style handbook. Let's take three example rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "* A preposition (such as for, to, etc.) is not a good thing to end a sentence with.\n",
    "* To boldly place an intervening word between the `to` and the `verb` in an infinitive is forbidden.\n",
    "* And you shouldn't begin a sentence with a conjunction (such as and, but, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "This isn't a completely unrealistic example. Talking right is something that many people still get [very excited](https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2015/oct/06/steven-pinker-alleged-rules-of-writing-superstitions) about.\n",
    "\n",
    "So that we have a large example text to work with, let's load the classic go-to text for all NLP examples ever, *Moby Dick*:"
