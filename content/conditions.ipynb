    "We are already able to write programs that are somewhat interactive; we get the user to type something in and then we process whatever they typed in. The next level of excitement for our users is to interact with a program that does completely *different* things depending on what they type in.\n",
    "\n",
    "So far, the 'flow' of our programs has always been linear; they carry out a series of steps in order, with no variations. We would now like to give the flow of our programs a branching structure, such that its behavior will vary depending on the circumstances. This can be achieved with [control statements](glossary.ipynb#control): lines of our program that do not on their own produce any result, but instead control when (or how often, or in what variations) other lines are run.\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the simplest kinds of control statement is a 'conditional' control statement. It tells Python to run certain lines of our program only if a certain condition is fulfilled. This is what we will learn about now.\n",

    "    * If they say yes, say \"Wow!\"\n",
    "    * If they say no, say \"Well that is quite a coincidence that you have the same name.\"\n",
    "  * Else if their surname is 'Hasselhoff', ask \"Any relation to David Hasselhoff?\"\n",
    "    * If they say yes, say \"Wow!\"\n",
    "    * If they say no, say \"You never know, you might be.\"\n",
    "  * Else if their initials are 'DH', say \"You have the same initials as David Hasselhoff!\"\n",
    "  * Else if their first name is a variant of 'David' such as 'Dave', 'Davy', 'Dafydd', say \"Your name is a bit like 'David', as in 'David Hasselhoff'.\"\n",
    "  * Else, as a last resort, say \" suppose you could change your name to something more interesting, like 'David Hasselhoff'.\"\n",

Not Mrs. Boolean and her husband Julian, but the Python [data type](glossary.ipynb#type) that stores one of just two possible values: `True` or `False`. In order to be able to build conditions into our programs, we need first to learn a bit more about booleans and the logic that governs them.\n",

    "That covers the very basics of logical statements in Python. Before we see how to turn logical statements into conditions for carrying out a part of a our program, let's take a brief detour to consider a slight quirk in the way Python handles the boolean data type.\n",
    "\n",
    "We have learned that some data types can be converted into others, using [built-in](glossary.ipynb#builtin) functions that have the same names as the type we wish to convert to (for example `int()` for converting to integer, and `str()` for converting to string). Initially, it may seem strange to allow converting other types into booleans, since booleans are always just `True` or `False`. Is the integer `42` on its own a 'true' number or a 'false' number? What about a string like `'JavaScript is a terrible programming language.'`? (Of course, some strings may contain true statements, but Python can't be expected to work this out.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Nonetheless, Python does allow us to convert other data types to boolean. How does it decide whether numbers or strings are 'true' or not? If you feel like a challenge, you might like to head to the Spyder console now and try converting a few strings and numbers to boolean (the type conversion function is `bool()`) to see whether you can discover the pattern.\n",
