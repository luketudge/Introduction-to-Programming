They may instead use a variety of other encodings with names like 'Latin-1', 'ISO-8859', or 'Windows-1252'. Some of these are equivalent for certain subsets of characters, and only become incompatible for a few obscure characters, such as special kinds of quote mark.

For example, some pieces of information may be in the form of text, some may be numbers, and some may be more complex things such as a link to a file on the computer's disk, or a connection to a website. When we create or refer to information in our Python programs, Python needs to be able to know what type of information it is.

For example, quote marks `''` indicate a [string](#string) (i.e. text).\n",
