    "Various tasks in science and mathematics involve manipulating collections of numbers organized in vectors or matrices. You may remember this from high school or college, depending on how far you took math. In this lesson we will learn about how to manipulate vectors and matrices with Python, so let's start by briefly recapping what these things are.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "A [vector](glossary.ipynb#vector) is a collection of multiple numbers arranged in a specific order. Vectors have various uses. They can be used in data analysis to represent multiple observations of the same type. For example, some shoe sizes:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "42 & 39 & 72 & 45 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors are also commonly used to represent points in a multidimensional space. For example, a vector of three numbers could record the *height, width, depth* coordinates of a point in three-dimensional space:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "2.4 & 1.0 & 3.7 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Matrices\n",
    "\n",
    "As well as being a virtual-reality environment in which our machine overlords keep us entertained while harvesting our energy in defiance of the laws of thermodynamics, a [matrix](glossary.ipynb#matrix) is a collection of multiple numbers arranged in rows and columns. Like vectors, matrices have various purposes in practical applications of math. A matrix might record multiple observations of multiple variables, where each row is an observation and each column is a variable. For example, for four people, their shoe sizes, IQ scores, and whether or not they work as a clown (`0` for 'no' and `1` for 'yes'):\n",

    "45 & 85 & 0 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Or a matrix might record the coordinates of a group of points in some space. For a two-dimensional space, the matrix might have two columns, representing the *x* and *y* (or horizontal and vertical) axes of the space, and each row would then represent one point in the space. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix}\n",
    "1 & 2 \\\\\n",
    "5 & 3 \\\\\n",
    "9 & 4 \\\\\n",
    "13 & 5 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "These two example uses of matrices are not in fact as different as they might appear. They can be considered within the same conceptual framework. Just as *x,y* coordinates may represent points in an actual 2-dimensional space (or *x,y,z* coordinates may represent points in a 3-dimensional space), so too can the people represented in the rows of data in our first example be thought of as 'points' in an abstract 'feature space' whose axes are 'shoe size', 'IQ score', and 'clown'. This gives us a more general way of thinking about what matrices typically represent in applied math. The rows often represent the locations of entities in some space (whether a real physical space or an abstract feature space), and the columns represent the dimensions of that space. Many of the calculations and transformations that we apply to data in the process of statistical analysis can also be thought of as geometric operations applied to points in a real physical space, such as rotating them, moving them, squashing them together, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vectors, which we learned about above, can be considered special cases of matrices that have either only one row, in which case the vector is termed a 'row vector' and might represent a single entity such as a person, or only one column, in which case the vector is termed a 'column vector' and might represent the positions of multiple entities along just one scale or dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of matrix math, an ordinary lone number (such as just `2`) is often called a [scalar](#scalar), to distinguish it from vectors and matrices. Likewise, a scalar can be considered a special case of a matrix with only one row and only one column; so in the terms we have been using above, a single piece of information about a single entity.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if you are familiar with 'normal' math involving single numbers then like Mr. Jourdain you have in fact already been doing matrix math all this time without knowing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Matrix multiplication\n",
    "\n",
    "As we just noted, matrices can be used to represent geometric transformations. How does this work? For many simple transformations, the calculations are also very simple, and may involve for example adding or subtracting some number from all the values in the matrix. But for some transformations we need new mathematical tools that are special to matrices. One of the most important of these is the notion of matrix multiplication: Multiplying a matrix not by some single number but by *another matrix*.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this work? To multiply one matrix (*A*) by another (*B*), follow these steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The number of *columns* in matrix A must be the same as the number of *rows* in matrix B. (If not, multiplication is not defined for the two matrices. This is very different from [scalars](glossary.ipynb#scalar); any single number may be in principle be multiplied by any other.)\n",
    "* Draw the A matrix at the left of your school notebook, and draw the B matrix above and to the right, as in the image below.\n",
    "* Draw a new matrix AB in the space between A and B, where each cell of AB aligns with one row of A and one column of B.\n",
    "* For each combination of row from A and column from B ...\n",
    "  * ... read left to right along the row of A, ...\n",
    "  * ... read down the column of B, ...\n",
    "  * ... and as you do so pair up the corresponding two values from A and B ...\n",
    "  * ... and multiply them together.\n",
    "  * Then sum up all the results of these multiplications and put their sum in the corresponding cell of the new AB matrix.\n",

    "#### Rotation\n",
    "\n",
    "Rotation is one example of a geometric transformation that can be represented as a matrix multiplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a matrix whose rows are the *x,y* coordinates of some points in a 2-dimensional space, another matrix, a 'rotation matrix', can be used to rotate those coordinates by some angle around the center of the space. When the matrix of coordinates is multiplied by this rotation matrix, the result is a new matrix of points whose values represent the rotated *x,y* coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "The rotation matrix for counter-clockwise rotation by an angle of $\\theta$ (in [radians](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radian)) is:\n",

    "-\\sin \\theta & \\cos \\theta \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "So if we wanted to rotate the *x,y* coordinates in our example matrix from above by an angle of 0.79 radians, we could represent this as the multiplication of our matrix by the rotation matrix for this angle:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",

    "-\\sin 0.79 & \\cos 0.79 \\\\\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take rotation of coordinates as an example and see how to implement it in Python. Our goal is to write a function that rotates a matrix of *x,y* coordinates around some point.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Arguments:\n",
    "  * The matrix of coordinates.\n",
    "  * An angle of rotation.\n",
    "  * The point around which to rotate the coordinates, with a default value of *0,0* (i.e. the 'center' of the coordinate space).\n",
    "* Return value:\n",
    "  * A new matrix of rotated coordinates.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's also use Python to produce a graph displaying the unrotated and rotated coordinates, so that we can check that our function works correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Arrays\n",
    "\n",
    "As we have done sometimes before, we will build up to our target function step by step. The first thing we need to know is how to represent a matrix in Python.\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic Python does not provide a 'matrix' [data type](glossary.ipynb#type). But we have already met some Python types that could be used to do the job. Matrices contain multiple values, so we need a data type that can store multiple values. A [list](glossary.ipynb#list) is an obvious first choice. For example, we could represent a matrix as a list in which each entry in the list represents one row, where each of those entries contains a further list, whose entries represent the values in that row.\n",

    "Certain conventions have arisen about these aliases. `numpy` is always 'np', `pyplot` is always 'plt', and `pandas` (which we met briefly in the [lesson on files](files.ipynb#pandas)) is always 'pd'. So you should be aware of these when you read other example programs.\n",

    "There are a couple of situations in which it is a good idea to use an alias for an imported module:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The name of the module is horribly long and the module is used often in the program. Using a much shorter alias can make the program less cluttered and easier to read.\n",
    "* There are other things (other modules, variables, etc.) in the program that have, or might have, the same name as the module. Using an alias avoids these naming conflicts.\n",
    "\n",
    "But in my semi-humble opinion, the common use of aliases for `numpy`, `pyplot`, `pandas`, and so on is a bit silly. Neither of the two situations above applies. These modules all have short names already, and you are probably more likely to want to call a variable in your program 'np' or 'pd' than you are to want to call it 'numpy' or 'pandas', unless you are doing research on actual pandas or have misspelled the word '[numpty](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/numpty)'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So I won't use aliases in my examples, except in one or two cases where it really makes sense. You should do whatever you prefer. Just be consistent and if you use aliases use the conventional ones rather than ones you have invented yourself, so that others understand what is going on in your program.\n",

    "In geometry, to [translate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)) some coordinates simply means to move them by a certain distance in a certain direction within the coordinate space. One way of representing this transformation is as the addition of a vector to the coordinates, as we learned above. For example, to move a pair of *(x,y)* coordinates 3 units rightward along the *x* axis and 2 units downward along the *y* axis we would add the vector *(3,-2)*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Add a new function to the [coordinates.py](examples/coordinates.py) module, called `translate()`. Like `rotate()`, `translate()` should take as its first [argument](glossary.ipynb#argument) a 2-column `numpy` array representing some coordinates, and it should [return](glossary.ipynb#return) a transformed version of the coordinates. The second argument should be a [list](glossary.ipynb#list) (or a [tuple](glossary.ipynb#tuple), it doesn't matter) whose two entries give the distances by which to shift the coordinates along the *x* and *y* axes, respectively. So for the example of shifting the coordinates 3 units rightwards along the *x* axis and 2 units downward along the *y* axis, this argument would be `[3, -2]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "It will probably help to test your function visually using `matplotlib` as you go along, to confirm that it works as expected."
