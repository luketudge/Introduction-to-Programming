Quote marks distinguish strings (i.e. literal text) from other things such as numbers, the names of other variables, or Python commands, all of which are written without quote marks. This is similar to the use of quote marks in everyday English. Think of the lyrics to the song [Say My Name](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Say_My_Name) by Destiny's Child. When Beyoncé issues the instruction *say my name*, she intends *my name* to be replaced by her actual name when the instructions are carried out.

But on the other hand, it means that we can occasionally make some big mistakes in our programs without immediately becoming aware of it.

Python would give no warning and would go ahead with what we asked even though the result is not what we want.
