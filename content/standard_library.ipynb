    "In the [previous lesson](modules.ipynb), we saw that Python programs can [import](extras/glossary.ipynb#import) some of their components from other files. Such additional files that are not in themselves programs but instead provide *components* for programs are known as [modules](extras/glossary.ipynb#module).\n",
    "\n",
    "We started out by writing our own modules, to see how the whole idea works. But we can also import modules that we get from elsewhere. For even moderately complex programs, we will almost always need to import and use some additional components that we did not write ourselves. If we start work on a new task and we find that it cannot easily be accomplished using the basic operations and data types, or if we don't even know how to begin, then we should ask ourselves: Is this a task that lots of other people will probably have needed to do before? If it is, then we might be able to save ourselves some time by searching first for a pre-made module that provides some of the building blocks that we need.\n",
    "\n",
    "We might find that we first need to download and install some of the modules that we decide we want to use. But in many cases this is not necessary. A standard Python installation comes with a large collection of pre-made modules for many common programming tasks. This collection of modules that is already included when we install Python is known as the 'standard library'. The term 'library' is used here to indicate that, like the knowledge stored in a library, the contents of these extra modules are not immediately available to us, but can be accessed by going to the library and 'reading in' one of the 'books'. The Python language is organized so as to provide only the very basics at its core: a few [built-in functions](extras/glossary.ipynb#builtin), mathematical [operators](extras/glossary.ipynb#operator), the most useful [data types](extras/glossary.ipynb#type), and some [control statements](extras/glossary.ipynb#control) (there are admittedly a *few* more things than just these, but we won't look at many more of them in this class). The core of the language is kept small and simple, and programmers only bring in as much of the extras as they need for a given task.\n",
    "\n",
    "So what extra modules are contained in the standard library? You can find a full list of them at the official Python documentation pages [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/), but this is a little overwhelming to read all at once. Instead of going through them exhaustively, we will just consider some examples of how to use them. In future lessons, we will meet more modules from the standard library that are useful for specific tasks.\n",

If you head to Google and search for 'Python pi' you will find that the first few results mention the `math` module. `math` is a module in Python's standard library that provides some additional mathematical functions, as well as constants like *pi* or *[e](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E_(mathematical_constant))*.\n",

    "## Third-party packages\n",
    "\n",
    "If the standard library is called 'standard', is there a 'non-standard' library? Yes there is. We mentioned before that it is possible to download and install modules that somebody else has written. If you install such extra modules, they are added to your Python 'library' on your computer, and you can import them just like modules from the standard library.\n",
    "\n",
    "Installable extra modules that were written by somebody else are often termed 'third-party' packages. A [package](extras/glossary.ipynb#package) is a program that adds new capabilities to an existing program. Third-party packages for Python add new modules to your Python installation. The 'third-party' in this case is some other programmer that is neither you nor the developers of Python itself (you are presumably the 'first party' and the developers of Python are the 'second party'). Because Python is such a popular programming language, there is a huge variety of third-party packages out there on the internet, all dealing with various specialist tasks. When you come to write real programs, you will often find that you need to make use of one or more third-party packages, which you may first need to install before you start work on your program.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is sometimes possible to just download somebody else's *py* files containing the components that you want to use. But this is usually not a good idea. If you use manually-downloaded files, you will also need to update them manually if newer versions become available, and you will need to ensure that the files are in the working directory that your main program runs in when it imports them. Instead, you will usually want to install third-party packages so that they are available wherever you are working, and you will want to install them from some central location that you can refer back to if you need to update them. The Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) is an online [repository](extras/glossary.ipynb#repository) of Python packages. It is the standard place to look for existing third-party packages that might help you with your current programming task.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to note some caveats when it comes to third-party packages. That a package is stored on PyPI is not of itself any guarantee that the package works correctly or even that it won't damage your Python installation. More or less anybody can upload their own Python package to PyPI, and many of the packages stored there are out of date, broken, or don't do correctly what they claim. The standard library is produced by the developers of Python, so it can almost always be relied on to work correctly and efficiently, or to be quickly fixed if it does not.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, it is a good idea to stick to the standard library when you can. But if you perform specialized tasks in programming, you will often be unable to avoid relying on third-party packages. Here are a couple of things to check when deciding whether to use one, and which one to choose if more than one is available for what you want to do:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Do many other people use this package? If lots of people are using a package, that probably means that it at least works. And the fact that lots of people are using it usually means that [bugs](extras/glossary.ipynb#bug) won't go unnoticed and may even be quickly fixed by one of the other users.\n",
    "* Is the package still being 'maintained' (i.e. are the developers of the package currently still fixing bugs and responding to questions)? If a package hasn't been updated for a long time, it might no longer work in the current version of Python, or you might have nobody to turn to if you have problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "For some of the specialist topics later on we will need to [import](extras/glossary.ipynb#import) modules from third-party packages. When we do, I will note whether an `import` is from the standard library or whether it is from a third-party package, and I will provide instructions for installing it if necessary. However, if you have installed Python via Anaconda, then almost all of the third-party packages that we need for this class will already have been installed by default. You can read a list of all the additional packages that Anaconda installs for you at the [Anaconda package listings](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/packages/pkg-docs/).\n",

    "The `string` module provides some additional variables that can be useful for working with strings. Among them is the `punctuation` variable, which contains punctuation characters. Use this variable to create a function called `standardized_words()`. This function returns a list of the words in a text, but in a 'standardized' form. Your function should take a string input argument containing some text, remove all the punctuation, make the contents lowercase, and then return a list of the words in the text.\n",

You can find a list of the 20 possible answers from the original Magic 8-Ball [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball#Possible_answers), or you can define your own shorter list of answers if you don't fancy typing all those into your program.\n",
